The Post Retirement Medical Benefit Scheme (PRMBS) is a full-stack web 
application that digitizes the annual contribution and live verification 
process for legitimate retired employees of an organization. It ensures 
that users can securely log in, make an annual payment (via Razorpay), 
and submit a live certificate â€” all without the need for physical 
paperwork or visits.
